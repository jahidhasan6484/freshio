Every detail in this dress (30% OFF RIGHT NOW TOO) is incredible from the gorgeous eyelet lace to the floral pattern to the scalloped hem. I love the length of this one too – especially with the hem detail. Feels so feminine! This would make the prettiest wedding guest dress if you have any upcoming events – love!",
        "content11": "I last minute bought one of this designer’s dresses in CA last spring and could not stop wearing it. Their dresses are super flattering but I especially love this one! The smocked bodice with the full sleeves and skirt feel like a 2021 take on a princess dress. The dress keeps it’s shape really well too.",

It feels super easy to wear and really versatile – perfect one-and-done outfit for spring/summer, the beach, traveling, etc. I ended up returning this one and keeping the one below but I loved both!",
        "content22": "This dress I’ve already worn a couple times. I love the combo of the multiple shades of blue with the micro floral print. Another options that’s really easy to wear for tons of occasions. It’s also on major sale right now – 50% off!",
        "content33": "Every couple years I’ll pull the trigger on a designer tee and this year I couldn’t pass up on this Fendi tee. I’m obsessed with the color and the logo stitching on the front. I don’t own a ton of designer tees but the ones I do own get worn on repeat. They are all amazing quality and you can literally wear them forever if you take care of them, whereas with other tees you might get only a year or two of wear before it starts to fade or loose shape. All this to say… love this Fendi tee and will be wearing it for years! Haha. Perfect tee to wear with some cut-off shorts or dress up with some pretty high-waisted trousers and heels. Also can we talk about these pants?! The color is everything! Love the whole look paired with this mini-crossbody."
